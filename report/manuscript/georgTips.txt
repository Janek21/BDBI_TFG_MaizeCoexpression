a few quick comments, I assume this is not yet the final version ðŸ™‚:

Missing the WGCNA cluster results using the total of all samples/genotypes (at least the figure), and a description of these results.

Maybe you could sometimes include the reasons why you have selected a specific approach (eg using RPKM for WGCNA, community clustering instead of dbscan or kmeans)? 
	Maybe some plots etc in the supplement, in the main text you show only major approach/results.

Too focused on methods/technical aspects. Instead of a narrative (first I did this then this etc) 
	Try to write direct style, eg. 
		WGCNA analysis revealed xx modules. Module sizes varied between a and b, with a mean size of xy. The grey module, generally indicative of noisy or not well clustered genes, contained only xy% of all genes highlighting a successful module separation.


Sometimes you drift in a description of method/protocol, eg
	"Once the significance for each function in each module has been calculated and written to a table, a program reads the aforementioned table, writes a file containing the most significant functions, their P-values, and the module that they belong to"
		Try to put such things into methods/scripts part. 
		Here it would be only relevant
			Determination of (with statistical significance) enriched functions in various modules
			That enriched functions can differ between modules (with examples).
	Eg. "Modules were enriched at different significance levels for distinct biological functions. A summary table (table xy) lists the most significant functions for each module. (Then discuss a few modules for their functions, and whether this is coherent with the WGCNA tissue correlation!)


Try to write directly, and only focused on results, all methods, scripts, test details etc should go into materials and methods.
