# PGSB_CoexpressionNW

This repository contains the files and data for executing a network co-expression analysis on maize lines B73, DK105, EP1, F7 and PE75.
It has programs for both of the the analysis done in my internship[] and in my bachelor thesis[].

The original expression data[] has been kept, but there is also the processed and split data (containing the gene length[] and without the gene length[]), the mercator annotation data can also be found, as well as the data belonging to _Zea Mays_ genes and the protein[] and canonical[] sequences of this same species.

The programs for preprocessing the data can be found in the {scripts} folder and are all executed through a bash[] file.
