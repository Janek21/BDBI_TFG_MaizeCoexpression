Cob	Central structure of the maize ear; supports kernel development.
Coleoptile	Protective sheath for emerging shoot during germination.
Crown root	Adventitious root for structural support and nutrient uptake.
First elongated internode	Stem segment that supports vertical growth and leaf separation.
Flag leaf	Final, uppermost leaf; key for photosynthesis during grain filling.
Immature cob	Young cob; contains undeveloped ovules.
Immature tassel	Developing male flower structure before pollen formation.
Leaf 1	First seedling leaf; initiates early growth.
Leaf 3 blade	Flat, photosynthetic part of the third leaf.
Leaf 3 sheath	Wraps around stem; supports and protects leaf base.
Leaf 5	Fifth leaf; contributes to photosynthesis during vegetative growth.
Leaf 5 elongation zone	Area of Leaf 5 where cells expand for growth.
Leaf 5 mature	Fully grown Leaf 5; actively photosynthesizing.
Leaf 5 meristem		Region producing cells for Leaf 5 development.
Leaf 8	Later-forming leaf; part of the plantâ€™s mature canopy.
Seed	Contains embryo and nutrients; initiates plant life.
Meiotic tassel	Male flower undergoing meiosis to form pollen.
Mesophyll	Leaf tissue where photosynthesis occurs (contains chloroplasts).
Prepollinated cob	Cob formed before receiving pollen; ovules unfertilized.
Primary root	First root; anchors seedling and absorbs nutrients.
Primary root elongation zone	Root area where cells elongate to extend the root.
Primary root meristematic zone	Tip of root where active cell division occurs.
Root hair zone	Region where root hairs form; increases absorption surface area.
Seminal root	Roots from the seed that support early plant development.
Silk	Female flower structure; captures pollen for fertilization.
